<h1>Seeing litter all around us is not pleasant, nor healthy, yet some people still throw their garbage outside of recycling garbage cans. On the other hand, we have people who volountarely clean that up and our goal is to reward them! For those who do throw their garbage where they should, but don&#39;t do any extra work to clean after others, this might encourage you to do so. There are always gonna be people who litter, however, if we clean that up to a certain degree, the litter would no more be noticable. The way we decided to help get to that stage, is by letting you share your accomplishments when it comes to cleaning litter up and reward you for it, once our economy is completed.&nbsp;</h1>
